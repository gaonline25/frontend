          <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
          <p>
            The intellectual property in the materials contained in this website
            are owned by or licensed to Goldfingers Aesthetics and are protected
            by applicable copyright and trademark law. We grant our users
            permission to download one copy of the materials for personal,
            non-commercial transitory use.
          </p>
          <p>
            This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title.
            This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of
            these restrictions or the Terms of Service, and may be terminated by
            Goldfingers Aesthetics at any time.
          </p>

          <h3>Liability</h3>
          <p>
            Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an 'as
            is' basis. To the extent permitted by law, Goldfingers Aesthetics
            makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and
            negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied
            warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a
            particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property, or
            other violation of rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            In no event shall Goldfingers Aesthetics or its suppliers be liable
            for any consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third
            party arising from the use or inability to use this website or the
            materials on this website, even if Goldfingers Aesthetics or an
            authorized representative has been notified, orally or in writing,
            of the possibility of such damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the context of this agreement, "consequential loss" includes any
            consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss of
            profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of
            goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation,
            loss of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether under
            statute, contract, equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity,
            or otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
            warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
            incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
          </p>

          <h3>Severance</h3>
          <p>
            Any term of these Terms of Service which is wholly or partially void
            or unenforceable is severed to the extent that it is void or
            unenforceable. The validity of the remainder of these Terms of
            Service is not affected.
          </p>

          <h3>Governing Law</h3>
